# 🧠 code-to-crack

Welcome to **code-to-crack** — a personal log of problem-solving workouts designed to challenge, stretch, and improve reasoning and coding skills through consistent daily practice.

This is not about competitive coding, interviews, or speed — it’s about deep thinking, clean problem-solving, and building long-term coding intuition.

## 🎯 Purpose

Like physical exercise strengthens the body, solving algorithmic problems daily strengthens the mind. This repository serves as a **daily practice space** to:

- Sharpen analytical and logical thinking
- Explore new patterns and paradigms
- Develop clean, idiomatic Go code
- Learn by doing, failing, and refining


---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language**: Go (Golang)
- **Editor**: VS Code / Goland
- **Test Framework**: Built-in `testing` package

📚 Learning Focus

While solving problems, emphasis is placed on:
	•	Understanding the why, not just the how
	•	Writing readable, idiomatic Go code
	•	Using data structures and patterns wisely
	•	Building a habit of reflection and review

🔄 Daily Practice Flow
	1.	Pick a new or previous problem to attempt
	2.	Solve it without looking at external help
	3.	Write clean code with test coverage
	4.	Reflect on the solution in comments if needed
	5.	Commit with meaningful messages

🚧 Ongoing Challenges
	•	⏳ 30-Day Reasoning Sprint (Started: June 2025)
	•	🧠 Rewriting classic problems with constraints
	•	🧪 Adding generics-based utilities in Go
	•	🌱 Exploring concurrency and parallelism challenges

📎 Notes

This repository is open for inspiration and sharing. It is a personal journey log — feel free to fork, follow, or adapt the idea for your own coding growth.

🧘‍♂️ Mindset

“Don’t just solve problems. Solve yourself into a better thinker.”

Let the code crack your comfort zone.
